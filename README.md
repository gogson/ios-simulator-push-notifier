## Why?

Testing push notifications on the iOS Simulator normally means hand-editing JSON files and running `xcrun simctl push` from the terminal. **iOS Simulator Push Notifier** gives you a visual editor, folder-based organization, and one-click delivery — so you can focus on building your app instead of wrestling with payloads.

## Features

### 🔔 Full APNS Payload Editor

Build complete Apple Push Notification payloads without touching JSON. Edit the alert title, subtitle, body, badge, sound, category, thread ID, content-available, mutable-content, and arbitrary custom data fields — all from a clean form UI. A live JSON preview keeps you in sync.

### 📁 Folder Organization

Group notifications into folders just like Apple Notes. Create, rename, reorder, and delete folders. Move all notifications from one folder to another in a single action. An **All Notifications** view shows everything at a glance.

### 📱 Simulator Auto-Detection

Booted simulators are detected automatically and refresh every 5 seconds. Installed apps are discovered via `simctl listapps`, so you can pick the target bundle identifier from a dropdown instead of typing it by hand.

### ▶️ One-Click Send

Hit **Run** (or <kbd>⌘↩</kbd>) to push the current notification to the selected simulator instantly.

### 📤 Import & Export `.apns` Files

- **Import** — Open `.apns` / `.json` files via the file picker or **drag-and-drop** them onto a folder.
- **Export** — Download any notification as a portable `.apns` file.

### ⏱️ Scheduling

Send a notification once after a delay, or set up a recurring cron schedule. Active schedules survive app restarts and show a status banner in the editor.

### ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action               | Shortcut          |
| -------------------- | ----------------- |
| New Notification     | <kbd>⌘N</kbd>    |
| New Folder           | <kbd>⌘⇧N</kbd>   |
| Delete               | <kbd>⌘⌫</kbd>    |
| Run Notification     | <kbd>⌘↩</kbd>    |
| Schedule             | <kbd>⌘⇧S</kbd>   |

### 🌙 Dark Mode

Ships with a dark theme that respects the native macOS look and feel.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **macOS** with [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed (for `xcrun simctl`)
- At least one booted iOS Simulator

### Install

Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/gogson/ios-simulator-push-notifier/releases).

### Unsigned App Notice

This app is **not code-signed or notarized** by Apple. macOS will block it from opening by default. To allow it:

1. Try to open the app — macOS will show a warning and refuse.
2. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.
3. Scroll down to the **Security** section — you'll see a message about the blocked app.
4. Click **Open Anyway** and confirm.

You only need to do this once.
